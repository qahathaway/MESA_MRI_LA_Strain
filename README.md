# Association between pericardial fat and left atrial strain assessed by cardiac MRI in MESA

## Background:
The earliest manifestations of diastolic dysfunction are typically evident in altered left atrial dynamics or pulmonary inflow patterns, which could be a good target for early diastolic dysfunction detection. Left atrial functional and volumetric changes are amongst the first imaging changes seen in Obesity and type 2 diabetes, and therefore may be a useful marker of early disease

## Objectives:
We hypothesize that pericardial fat correlates with MRI-derived atrial strain measurements

## Methods:
Patients with MRI for left atrial strain (n=2884) in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) were examined. Measurements at Exam 1-4 were collected to evaluate associations with left atrial strain (Exam 5).

## Figure 1:
Methodological overview of assessing the relationship between volume of pericardial fat and left atrial strain. Baseline variables for Models 1-3 were collected at Exam 1. Potentially confounding variables, including body mass index (BMI), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol, triglycerides, and volume of pericardial fat, were further assessed at a follow-up visit. The follow-up visit selected was the visit with the most recent volume of pericardial fat measurement. Analyses in the study were ultimately conducted on those patients (n=2884) who received MRI for left atrial strain. Evaluation metrics included linear regression, multiple linear regression, and machine learning through random forest regression. CKD-EPI GRF = Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration Equation for GFR, CAC Score = Mean: Agatston Calcium Score, Phantom-Adjusted.

## Figure 2:
Figure 2: Linear regression for each of the left atrial strain measurements as compared to (A) volume of pericardial on Exam 1 and on the (B) Proximal Exam. Left atrial strain measurements were normalized using base R. The shaded area represents the 95% CI. Exam 1 is the first MESA exam. Proximal Exam refers to the exam closest to Exam 5 in which volume of pericardial fat was measured. LAVMAX = Left Atrial Maximum Volume by MTT (mL), LAVPREA = Left Atrial Pre-atrial Contraction Volume by MTT (mL), LAVMIN = Left Atrial Minimum Volume by MTT (mL), LASMAX = Left Atrial Peak Longitudinal Strain by MTT (%), LASRMAX = Left Atrial Peak Positive Longitudinal Strain Rate by MTT (%/ms), LASRE = Left Atrial Peak Early-diastolic Longitudinal Strain Rate by MTT (%/ms), LASRA = Left Atrial Peak Atrial-diastolic Longitudinal Strain Rate by MTT (%/ms), LAVOLCIRCLE = Left Atrial Maximum Volume by CIRCLE (mL), LATEF = Left Atrial Total Ejection Fraction (%), LAPEF = Left Atrial Passive Ejection Fraction (%), LAAEF = Left Atrial Active Ejection Fraction (%).
